## üß™ Breast Cancer Prediction System

### Project Description
The **Breast Cancer Prediction System** leverages the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant. This system serves as a demonstration of supervised learning in healthcare.

### Key Features
- **Dataset**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression to find the accuracy rates.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
  3. Model training and evaluation.

### Outputs
- Prediction of tumor classification: benign or malignant.
- Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## üìö Book Recommendation System

### Project Description
The **Book Recommendation System** uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest books based on user preferences. It employs the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for creating personalized recommendations.

### Key Features
- **Dataset**: Publicly available book ratings dataset.
- **Algorithms Used**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Workflow**:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand user preferences.
  2. Building a recommendation engine using KNN.
  3. Evaluation of recommendations using user-item interaction data.

### Outputs
- Personalized book recommendations based on user input.
- Insights into the dataset through visualizations.
